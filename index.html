                <h3>SOBRE VICE CLUB</h3>
                <h4>¿Cómo nace Vice Club?</h4>
                <p>Vice Club nace como un proyecto personal de desarrollo web, además de que siempre sentí que hacía
                    falta una página que hable de los juegos de la saga sin tantos rodeos.</p>
                <h4>¿Qué puedo encontrar en Vice Club?</h4>
                <p>En Vice Club podrás encontar información agrupada por cada juego principal de la saga, como por
                    ejemplo la ficha técnica, coleccionables, mapas interactivos, trucos, artworks, mods, noticias y
                    más.</p>
                <h4>¿Cómo busco información por juego?</h4>
                <p>Es muy fácil. Simplemente tienes que tocar en el menú de arriba a la derecha, y podrás elegir el
                    juego que deseas consultar. Para volver a esta página principal, es tan sencillo como tocar en el
                    logo de Vice Club.</p>

                    saga GTA.</p>
